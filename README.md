## What is it

Small console program on Pascal for converting float numbers between any radix from 2 to 36. 

Written at school, runs in Turbo Pascal and Free Pascal. 

It converts correctly the integer part of the number, but incorrectly the float part of the number. 

## Install & Run

You can launch it in fpc, just 'fpc radix.pas'.

Install fpc using 'sudo apt-get install fpc' or similiar in Linux, or download it here for many different systems: [https://www.freepascal.org/download.var](https://www.freepascal.org/download.var).

Also, there is good online tool: [https://www.jdoodle.com/execute-pascal-online/](https://www.jdoodle.com/execute-pascal-online/).

## How to use
Firstly, enter the number in format like this: 25.18, ABE11, 901 etc and press Enter

Secondly, enter the radix of this number (from 2 to 36) and press Enter

Finally, enter the radix in whin you want to see the result and press Enter

You will see the result, for example '15255[10] = 3B97[16]'.
